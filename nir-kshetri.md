**Disinformation and misinformation in the age of artificial intelligence and the metaverse**

**Abstract**

This presentation explores how generative AI tools are enabling malicious actors to automate and enhance disinformation efforts. It begins by identifying key attributes of generative AI that contribute to the rapid creation and dissemination of false or misleading content, such as AI’s ability to generate highly convincing text, deepfakes, and synthetic media with minimal effort. Next, the presentation highlights specific case studies illustrating how AI has been used in recent disinformation campaigns, ranging from political influence operations to cybercriminal activities. Furthermore, the presentation delves into the broader societal implications, examining the potential impact of AI-driven disinformation on trust in institutions, public discourse, and democratic processes. It also evaluates current and emerging regulatory frameworks aimed at combating AI-generated disinformation. The presentation concludes by analyzing the benefits and costs of using AI for disinformation from the perspective of disinformation actors, focusing on how these tools amplify the efficiency and reach of their deceptive activities.
