**Detecting communication strategies surrounding COVID-19-related misinformation on social media**

**Abstract**

There is perhaps no bigger issue facing health communication right now than that of misinformation. Our team is developing a model of online information to better understand how to detect and mitigate bias in such models. We collected more than 10 terabytes of data from across Twitter and Instagram from 2020 to 2023. The data are focused on the topic of COVID vaccine misinformation and rhetorical strategies used surrounding these communication efforts, which the study team chose because of the strong historical record of misinformation across social media platforms. This lecture will discuss the importance of studying rhetorical strategies surrounding misinformation, the performance of different modeling approaches including traditional machine learning and deep learning, and key ways that bias can arise throughout the data collection and modeling process.
