**Mark Fiore**

Currently a John S. Knight journalism fellow at Stanford, Pulitzer Prize-winner Mark Fiore is a visual journalist who turns complex issues into accessible cartoons, animation and biting satire. His work has appeared on the San Francisco Chronicle’s website, Politico, Slate.com, CBSNews.com, NPR’s web site and many other online news, cable and broadcast outlets across the globe.

For over six years, Fiore was staff cartoonist at KQED, where he created daily topical single-panel cartoons and collaborated with reporters and editors on longer pieces of graphic journalism and animation.

Beginning his career drawing traditional editorial cartoons for newspapers like the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, Fiore turned to animation in 2001, when he pioneered the new form of animated political cartoons.

Growing up in California, Fiore also spent a good portion of his life in the backwoods of Idaho. It was this combination that shaped him politically. Mark majored in political science at Colorado College, where, in a perfect send-off for a cartoonist, he received his diploma in 1991 as commencement speaker Dick Cheney smiled approvingly.

Mark Fiore was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 2010 and was a Pulitzer finalist in 2018. He won the Herblock Prize in 2016, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award in 2019 and 2004, and has twice received an Online Journalism Award for commentary from the Online News Association. Fiore has received two awards in new media from the National Cartoonists Society and has received The James Madison Freedom of Information Award from The Society of Professional Journalists.
