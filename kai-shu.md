**Combating Misinformation in the Age of Generative AI: Challenges, Risks and Opportunities**

**Abstract**

In recent years, misinformation and disinformation have become a global issue. The wide dissemination of misinformation can have detrimental societal effects on individuals and the society. For example, false information is dividing people, polarizing groups, confusing readers, and can be weaponized by nation-states to exert their influence. The rise of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to reshape the fight against misinformation. However, LLMs are a double-edged sword in this battle. While they offer promising opportunities due to their extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities, they also pose significant risks to safety and security, as they can be exploited to generate deceptive misinformation at scale. In this talk, we look at some lessons learned when exploring strategies of harnessing LLMs for fact-checking, discuss challenges of detecting LLM-generated misinformation, and emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration across various stakeholders to address the complexities of combating misinformation in the age of generative AI.
