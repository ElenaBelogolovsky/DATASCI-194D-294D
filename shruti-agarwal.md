# Dr. Shruti Agarwal - Guest Speaker

## Lecture Date: November 18, 2024 (9:30 AM - 10:20 AM)

**Authenticity in the age of AI**

**Abstract**

The democratization of powerful editing and creation software, coupled with the widespread deployment of generative AI, has given rise to significant harms, including the production of non-consensual sexual imagery and various forms of fraud and disinformation. This situation raises serious concerns regarding the weaponization of these technologies against individuals, societies, and democratic institutions, as well as their potential to disrupt significant segments of the workforce. This presentation will introduce the generative AI techniques responsible for producing hyper-realistic visual content, exploring both their benefits and associated risks. Additionally, I will examine two broad categories of misinformation detection methods—passive and active approaches—evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each.
