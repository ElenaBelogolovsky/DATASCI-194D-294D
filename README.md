# Data Science of Disinformation (DATASCI-194D/294D)
## Stanford University, Fall 2024

## Course Description: Data Science of Disinformation 

Disinformation. Fake News. Digital Hate. Viral spread. These topics were rarely discussed 20, 15, or even 10 years ago, and yet today they are top of mind in politics, international affairs, and public health. This course, featuring several guest speakers, explores the advent of the "disinformation era" spawned by the rise of modern information technology and the new ways it can insert itself into our activities, thoughts, and discussions. We plan to discuss everything from data science algorithms to human perceptual tendencies to political movements involved in the active creation and spread of disinformation.

We have two effort levels: 1 unit/3 units and two curricular tracks: (a) a data scientist track, focusing on algorithms and data structures arising in the generation and mitigation of disinformation epidemics; and (b) a generalist track, focusing on the rapid changes in society, politics, economics, and mental health driven by the recent information technology.

We plan to have each week one lecture, two zoom office hours, supplemented by required readings and video/youtubes. Most weeks there will be one homework assignment. Depending on the effort level chosen, there could be a final project.

Imran Ahmed is the founder and CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate US/UK. He is an authority on social and psychological malignancies on social media, such as identity-based hate, extremism, disinformation, and conspiracy theories. He regularly appears on the media and in documentaries as an expert in how bad actors use digital spaces to harm others and benefit themselves, as well as how and why bad platforms allow them to do so. He advises politicians around the world on policy and legislation. Imran was inspired to start the Center after seeing the rise of antisemitism on the left in the United Kingdom and the murder of his colleague, Jo Cox MP, by a white supremacist, who had been radicalized in part online, during the EU Referendum in 2016. He holds an MA in Social and Political Sciences from the University of Cambridge. Imran lives in Washington DC, and tweets at @Imi_Ahmed.

Dr. Brandon is a senior research methodologist in the Methodology & Quantitative Social Sciences department at NORC at the University of Chicago. He leads work in natural language processing (NLP), research on research and science evaluation, and research data infrastructure. Brandon’s NLP work leverages advanced methods, such as deep learning and named-entity recognition, to generate meaningful insights from a wide range of text data, such as social media, administrative records, and surveys, and Brandon’s considerable expertise in data infrastructure allows him to help clients make their data assets secure, accessible, and interoperable. As a sociologist, he uses a deep knowledge of research on research to help clients across sectors monitor and evaluate investments in science, technology, and innovation.
Brandon’s data science work focuses on NLP and data infrastructure. NLP examples include using named-entity recognition to identify new e-cigarette brands and flavors on social media and developing text classifiers to monitor commercial smokeless tobacco campaigns across social media platforms. His work has entailed the use of deep learning to build a recommender system connecting synthetic biologists with information concerning the ethical and societal implications of their research as well as the development of tools—using algorithms such as topic models and stochastic blockmodels—to process open-ended responses to large-scale surveys. Brandon is helping the NCSES to establish a research data infrastructure integrating survey, administrative, and bibliometric data about the scientific workforce. He was Principal Investigator on a team of experts across the U.S. to develop the Synthetic Biology Knowledge System, which aims to provide a single interface that transforms the way researchers access diverse types of synthetic biology data.
