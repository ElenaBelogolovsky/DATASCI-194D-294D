**Orality, Literacy, and Digital Media: the Rise and Decline of Scientific Thinking**

**Abstract**

Data science and data visualization began 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia. Writing emerged from bookkeeping in ancient irrigation-based civilizations. In the first temple-states, priests kept records of offerings to control the water supply. Writing was not merely a way to record data. It transformed society.
When priests-bureaucrats decided how to stockpile the tablets, they needed to classify them. The concept of classification emerged along with unification and standardization. Data and then knowledge were rationally divided into various categories and disciplines. Teaching writing required an understanding of what it is. How do certain signs represent certain things? This led to the emergence of education, grammar, abstract thinking, and philosophy. 
Writing rewired the human brain. Rather than being immersed in the sensory bubble of surrounding reality, the literate mind became alienated from immediate situations and immersed in the realm of thought. Reflection replaced reflexes. Literacy separated the known from the knower, enabling knowledge to be contemplated “objectively,” according to its own abstract principles. Theorizing emerged. 
Instead of a simultaneous influx of data from the surroundings, writing organized information in a linear and sequential manner, one thing at a time. This linear arrangement required ordering and prioritizing. Human agency over information emerged. 
Overall, the cultural shift from orality to literacy entailed the move from magic to religion, from myth to logos, from polytheism to monotheism, from customs to laws, from moral relativism to the moral absolute, from practical and negotiated truths to objective and absolute truth, from environmental immersion to environmental detachment, from totemic identity to individualism, from wisdom to philosophy, from knowing to science, from the “cycle of life” to personal destiny, from the agitation of tribal belonging to the individual tragedy of (not-)becoming. 
Electronic, and now digital, media have enabled immediate and impulsive reactions, immersing humans back into an environment – though now digitally induced, not natural. This type of oral-like immersion can be termed “digital orality.”
Digital orality reverses the effects of literacy and retrieves some features of primary orality. Digital orality incites retribalization, reverts objective truth to its tribal, “negotiated” forms, and leads to the decline of scientific, rational thinking. Had Aristotle had a Twitter account, he would have said, “Truth is dear to me, but dearer still is Plato.”
We will discuss these and other challenges of digital orality and the ways of coping with them.
