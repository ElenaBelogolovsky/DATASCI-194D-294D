## Lecture Date: September 23, 2024 (9:30 AM - 10:20 AM)

**Abstract**

Kelly Weill will provide a brief overview of what constitutes a conspiracy theory and the common social and psychological forces that make people universally susceptible to conspiracy thinking to some extent. She will then explore how purveyors of disinformation are often early adopters of new communication technologies. Drawing from her book, she will explain how the flat earth movement exploited algorithm-based platforms like YouTube in the 2010s to reach a massive audience, with these algorithms also influencing the nature of the content, which was designed for viral spread. Weill will link these modern developments to two earlier booms in the flat earth movement: the early 20th century, when a religious community in Illinois disseminated its message by acquiring one of the nation's first long-range radio stations, and the mid-19th century in England, when the easing of taxes on newspapers led to a democratization of the press and a surge in sensationalist publications.
