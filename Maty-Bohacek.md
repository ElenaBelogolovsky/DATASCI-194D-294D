# Maty Bohacek - Guest Speaker

## Lecture Date: November 6, 2024 (9:30 AM - 10:20 AM)

 

**Abstract**

In the summer of 2023, we set out to create a photorealistic deepfake of CNN's Anderson Cooper using only open-source tools, publicly available data, and a consumer laptop. Over a few weeks, as a team comprising a first-year computer science student and his advisor, we successfully developed a deepfake convincing enough to open a primetime CNN show. This talk will detail the development process of our deepfake, contextualizing it within the broader landscape of disinformation. The talk will further present two deepfake detection methods: an identity-based approach that models the behavioral mannerisms of prominent figures and an identity-agnostic technique that exploits the shortcomings of lip-syncing technology. Finally, the talk will discuss the future of deepfake generation and detection.



**Bio**

Maty Bohacek is a sophomore at Stanford University, advised by Professor Hany Farid (UC Berkeley). His research focuses on problems at the intersection of AI and digital forensics. Maty's recent work investigates the effects of AI models re-ingesting their creations and methods for determining if a specific data point, such as an image, was used to train an AI model. He also developed a detector of deepfakes for President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and created a deepfake CNN news anchor, which opened a primetime news show spreading awareness of AI threats. His has been featured in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
