**AI & Social Manipulation**

**Abstract**

In this talk, Dr. Emilio Ferrara will overview his decadelong journey into understanding the implications of online platform manipulation. He'll start from detecting malicious bots and other forms of manipulation including troll accounts, coordinated campaigns, and disinformation operations. The impact of his work will be corroborated with examples of findings enabled by the technology, e.g., the unveiling of the "Russian bots" operation prior to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, which informed official Senate investigations and new regulations. He will then illustrate similar issues with the 2020, 2022 and 2024 U.S. Election, as well as COVID-related conspiracies and public health misinformation. Dr. Emilio Ferrara will conclude by discussing the ML tools he developed to model online mis/disinformation, reveal the malicious adversaries behind the curtains, and characterize their activity, behavior, and strategies, suggesting how they are changing the way researchers and study online platforms in the era of automation and artificial intelligence.
