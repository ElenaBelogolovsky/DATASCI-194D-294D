**Bio**

Imran Ahmed is the founder and CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, based in Washington, D.C. He is an authority on social and psychological malignancies on social media, such as identity-based hate, extremism, disinformation, and conspiracy theories. He regularly appears in the media and in documentaries as an expert on how bad actors use digital spaces to harm others and benefit themselves, as well as how and why bad platforms allow them to do so. Imran advises legislators around the world on how to regulate digital spaces – including the US Congress, the European Commission and the UK Government. He appears regularly in the media to discuss hate and misinformation on social media, and CCDH’s work to research and combat it. 
 
Imran was inspired to start the Center after seeing the rise of antisemitism on the left in the United Kingdom and the murder of his colleague, Jo Cox MP, by a white supremacist, who had been radicalized, in part, online during the EU Referendum in 2016. He holds an MA in Social and Political Sciences from the University of Cambridge.
